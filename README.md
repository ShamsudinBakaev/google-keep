# Google Keep

Hi! This project is a **Keep** clone inspired by my favorite **Google** app.

## Description

The project is a note-taking platform consisting of three main pages: Home, Archive and Trash. You can create notes and archive or delete them, as hinted at in the titles of the respective pages.

At the moment this is the main functionality of the project. I emphasize “for now” because my goal is to devote as much time as I feel inspired to this project. But besides this, there are other improvements that make using the application even more enjoyable.

The original of this site is my daily tool and it feels good to create something like this in an effort to improve and add more features.
